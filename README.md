# PkDataDecoder
This project decrypts and decodes the 100 byte pokemon data fragment from Generation 3 Pokemon games ( Starting Address 0x4360 for ruby )
The goal of the project is to allow the modification of whatever fields are desired, also to implement a GUI for simple interaction, and save file editing as well, rather than raw RAM modifications I also plan on building this to read whatever it can to act as a Corruption repair tool as well to hopefully repair corrupted save files

GUI is currently planning on being built with WxWidgets
